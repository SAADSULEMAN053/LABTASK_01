# LABTASK_01
This program displays the menu of food and let you choose from it and at the end it displays the total amount to pay. The program is written in C-LANGUAGE and uses SWITCH STATEMENT. This program can be written using if-else statement as well but by using switch statement it proves that in some cases switch statement can be an alternative for if/if-else statements.
